# Tidy data 

### What this is for:

This is for assignment of data cleaning as part of coursera data science course. 


### What's included 
In this project, a tidy data set is created out of the data provided by the assignment. 

List of file: 
+ Readme.md 
+ CodeBook.md - schema for tidy data
+ run_analysis.R - a script that is used to create this tidy data from original data
+ tidySmartphonesDataset.csv -  Average of each variable for each activity and each subject. You could reproduce the data using run_analysis.R.
